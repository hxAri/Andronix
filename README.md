## Abouts
**[Penguin](https://github.com/hxAri/Penguin)** is a Command Line Tool to simplify the installation of Linux Distros to the Android Operating System using Termux as a Shell environment. **[Penguin](https://github.com/hxAri/Penguin)** also supports more than 6 Linux Distros [see](#linux-distros), as well as several Desktop Environments [see](#desktop-environment) and also Window Manager [view](#window-manager).

For problems with graphics rendering you need to know that Termux does not support it however, don't worry about that you can still achieve it with the help of VNC Viewer you can download it via Play Store for free.

## Dependency
Does Penguin require additional dependencies? Yeah, but not much. All the required dependencies are all in a file called dependencies, you can read them with your favorite `cat` in the Terminal Emulator.

## Environment
If Penguin uses the Shell as a programming language, does it require virtualization such as a Virtual Environment in the Python language? It can be yes or no, the environment here is intended to be a different situation because Penguin is typed on a Laptop/PC so the **development** environment means that you will never install it, just create a system file folder like `{distro}-fs`

Meanwhile, the **production** environment is where you actually run it on your Termux and, you will actually install it.

## Installation
How to install Penguin? You don't need to bother with that problem, just clone or download the source code from this repository.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hxAri/Penguin
```
Let's change give the penguin executable permission
```sh

```
Now you can run the Penguin like this
```sh
bash Penguin/penguin
```
Or like this
```sh
. Penguin/penguin
```
Or this
